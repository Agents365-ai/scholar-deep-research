# scholar-deep-research — From Question to Cited Report

[中文文档](README_CN.md) &middot; 🌐 **Website:** [agents365-ai.github.io/scholar-deep-research](https://agents365-ai.github.io/scholar-deep-research/)

An 8-phase (Phase 0..7), script-driven academic research workflow that turns a research question into a structured, cited report. Multi-source federation across OpenAlex, arXiv, Crossref, and PubMed with deduplication, transparent ranking, citation chasing, and a mandatory self-critique pass.

## What it does

- **End-to-end research** — from question decomposition (Phase 0) to a finished report with bibliography (Phase 7), with 7 enforced phase-transition gates in between
- **Agent-native CLI** — structured JSON envelopes with `request_id` / `latency_ms` / `cli_version` on every response; `--idempotency-key` on every mutating command; `--dry-run` previews; destructive operations (`init --force`) gated behind a paired `--dangerous` acknowledgement; gate failures carry a `next: [commands]` hint so agents recover without a discovery round-trip
- **Parallel deep-read fan-out (Phase 3)** — selected papers split into `deep` / `skim` / `defer` tiers via deterministic triage. Deep tier dispatched in parallel waves of 8–10 agents, each reading one PDF in an isolated context bubble and writing structured evidence back through the exclusive-locked CLI. Skim tier auto-fills an abstract-derived evidence stub — no agent fan-out needed. Tunable via `--deep-ratio` / `--skim-ratio`; defaults shave roughly 50% off Phase 3 cost without losing coverage
- **PDF prefetch ahead of fan-out** — optional `prefetch_pdfs.py` step at the close of Phase 2 pulls every deep-tier PDF into a stable cache (via [paper-fetch](https://github.com/Agents365-ai/paper-fetch) with Unpaywall fallback) using `ThreadPoolExecutor` concurrency. Phase 3 agents then read a local file path instead of running their own download, and OA-chain failures surface as structured `pdf_status` records on the paper *before* dispatch — so a wave never starts only to discover half the PDFs are paywalled
- **4 federated sources** — OpenAlex (primary, free, 240M+ works), arXiv (preprints), Crossref (DOI metadata), PubMed (biomedical)
- **Transparent ranking** — papers are scored with a published formula (`α·relevance + β·citations + γ·recency + δ·venue_prior`), components written into state
- **Deduplication across sources** — DOI-first, then title-similarity merge; one paper, one record
- **Citation chasing (snowball)** — forward + backward graph expansion via OpenAlex
- **Persistent state file** — `research_state.json` tracks every query, paper, decision, and phase. Research is resumable and auditable
- **Three-axis saturation stop signal** — discovery ends only when *all* of paper-novelty (<20%), author-novelty (<25%), and venue-novelty (<30%) fall below threshold per source. Catches the failure mode where a query keeps surfacing different papers from the same lab or venue while exploration has actually stalled. Sources that don't report venues (e.g. arXiv) drop the venue axis cleanly via vacuous truth
- **Phase 1 budget envelope** — env-var-set caps on Phase 1 ingest (`SCHOLAR_PHASE1_MAX_ROUNDS` default 5, `SCHOLAR_PHASE1_MAX_REQUESTS_PER_SOURCE` default 20) prevent runaway agent loops. Trust boundary: agents cannot raise their own ceiling — a confused loop hits the cap and gets a structured `phase1_budget_exhausted` error rather than silently consuming the rest of your token budget. Caps lift automatically once the workflow advances past Phase 1, so Phase 4 citation chase is unaffected
- **5 report archetypes** — `literature_review` / `systematic_review` / `scoping_review` / `comparative_analysis` / `grant_background`, picked from user intent
- **Mandatory self-critique** — Phase 6 runs a 14-point adversarial checklist; findings go in the report appendix
- **Citation rigor** — every claim in the body carries a `[^id]` anchor; unanchored claims fail the gate
- **BibTeX / CSL-JSON / RIS export** — the bibliography is generated from state, not retyped
- **PDF text extraction** — `pypdf`-based, with scanned-PDF detection. `--doi` mode resolves papers via [paper-fetch](https://github.com/Agents365-ai/paper-fetch) (5-source OA chain) or Unpaywall fallback
- **MCP enrichment, not dependency** — uses Semantic Scholar (asta) and Brave Search MCP tools when available, but the workflow is fully functional without them
- Triggers proactively when a user question requires academic grounding

### vs Other research skills

| Feature | This skill | Generic "literature-review" prompts | Browser-driven scrapers |
|---------|------------|-------------------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Approach** | Scripts + SKILL.md | Pure prompt | Headless browser automation |
| **Determinism** | ✅ Same input → same papers | ❌ Vibes-based search | 🟡 Brittle to UI changes |
| **API key required** | ❌ None for OpenAlex/arXiv/Crossref | N/A | Often yes |
| **Rate-limit aware** | ✅ Polite-pool email opt-in | ❌ | 🟡 |
| **Resumable** | ✅ State file | ❌ | ❌ |
| **Citation chasing** | ✅ via OpenAlex graph | 🟡 ad hoc | ❌ |
| **Cross-source dedup** | ✅ Deterministic | ❌ | ❌ |
| **Self-critique gate** | ✅ Mandatory | ❌ | ❌ |
| **Archetype templates** | ✅ 5 | ❌ | ❌ |

### Key advantages

1. **Scripts-first, MCP-optional** — the workflow runs on stdlib HTTP. Semantic Scholar / Brave MCP tools are enrichment, not dependencies. When MCP times out, research keeps going.
2. **Transparent ranking** — the formula is printed, the weights are in state, every paper's component scores are inspectable. The report's methodology appendix can cite its own ranking.
3. **Persistent, auditable state** — every query, every dedupe, every selection lives in `research_state.json`. Research is resumable across sessions and reviewable by a third party.
4. **Saturation as stop signal** — discovery ends when the data says it should, not when the model gets tired.
5. **Self-critique is a phase, not a checkbox** — the 14-point Phase 6 checklist catches unanchored claims, venue/author skew, recency collapse, and untested high-citation papers. Findings go into the report appendix.
6. **5 report archetypes** — the right structure for the right question (literature review vs systematic vs scoping vs comparative vs grant background).
7. **Citation anchors enforced** — every claim in the body has `[^id]`; the export step catches unanchored prose.

## How it works

```
Phase 0  Scope        question decomposition + archetype + state init
Phase 1  Discovery    multi-source search → dedupe → 3-axis saturation check
Phase 2  Triage       ranking → top-N selection → tier triage → optional PDF prefetch
Phase 3  Deep read    parallel agent fan-out (deep tier) + abstract stub (skim tier)
Phase 4  Chasing      citation graph (forward + backward)
Phase 5  Synthesis    thematic clustering → tension map
Phase 6  Self-critique  14-point adversarial checklist (mandatory)
Phase 7  Report       render archetype template → export bibliography
```

Each phase transition has an enforced gate (G1..G7 in `scripts/_gates.py`). The workflow advances one gate at a time via `python scripts/research_state.py --state <path> advance` — a call that runs the gate predicate and refuses with a structured `gate_not_met` envelope (listing failing checks *and* suggested next commands) when criteria aren't met. There is no way to skip a gate by setting `phase` directly.

Every mutating command (`ingest`, `rank`, `dedupe`, `citation-chase`, plus the replay subcommands under `research_state.py`) accepts `--idempotency-key` — a retried call with the same key returns the original result without re-mutating state, so agent crash-recovery is contract-idempotent, not just naturally so. The state file itself is written under a sibling `.lock` file with atomic `os.replace`, so concurrent Phase 1 searches are race-free.

    class P0,P1,P2,P3,P4,P5,P6,P7 phase;
    class STATE state;
```

Every phase reads and writes `research_state.json` — it's the single source of truth that makes the workflow resumable and auditable. Phase 6 (self-critique) can loop back to Phase 1 when it finds gaps; everything else is linear.

### Design posture: deterministic spine, agentic skin

Every script under `scripts/` is pure data — search, dedupe, rank, citation-chase, bibliography export. **Zero LLM calls inside the pipeline.** The host LLM is the orchestrator: it reads `SKILL.md`, calls the CLI tools, decides what to do next based on JSON envelopes coming back. This separation buys three properties that LLM-in-the-loop pipelines can't have: **reproducibility** (same state → same output, no model nondeterminism), **auditability** (every mutation flows through one `research_state.py` boundary), and **testability** (the 148-test smoke suite at `scripts/tests/run.py` runs in ~4 s with no API keys, no network, no model). MCP tools and the host LLM enrich the agent's decisions; they never sit on the critical path.

## Prerequisites

- **Python ≥ 3.9**
- **Install dependencies:**
  ```bash
  pip install -r requirements.txt
  ```
  Pulls in `httpx` (HTTP client) and `pypdf` (PDF text extraction).

No API keys are required. For higher OpenAlex / Crossref / PubMed rate limits, pass `--email <you@host>` (polite pool) or `--api-key` (NCBI). All scripts work without these.

## Skill Installation

### 🪄 Quickest — just ask your agent

The simplest install is to let your coding agent do it. In **Claude Code**, **OpenAI Codex**, **OpenCode**, **OpenClaw**, **Hermes Agent**, or **pi-mono**, paste this:

```
Install https://github.com/Agents365-ai/scholar-deep-research for me, then run pip install -r requirements.txt inside it.
```

The agent will:
1. Recognize this as an Agent Skills repo (`SKILL.md` at the root)
2. `git clone` it into the correct skills directory for whichever platform is hosting it (e.g. `~/.claude/skills/`, `~/.config/opencode/skills/`, `~/.openclaw/skills/`, `~/.hermes/skills/research/`, `~/.pimo/skills/`, or `~/.agents/skills/`)
3. Install Python dependencies (`httpx`, `pypdf`)
4. Confirm the skill is loaded and ready

After that, ask for a research report and the skill triggers automatically. No manual `git clone` needed.

If you prefer to do it by hand, the per-platform commands are below.

```

### SkillsMP

```bash
skills install scholar-deep-research
```

### Updating

The skill **auto-updates on invocation.** Every time a host LLM activates `scholar-deep-research` for a new research task, Phase 0 Step 0 runs `python scripts/check_update.py`, which:

1. `git fetch`es the upstream remote (the one network call) — typically a few hundred milliseconds
2. Fast-forwards the local checkout if an update is available
3. Refuses to touch your working tree if you have local edits — you'll see a one-line `[Skill update skipped — you have local changes …]` notice instead of having work clobbered
4. Detects `requirements.txt` drift and surfaces a hint; **pip install is never run automatically** (the skill doesn't know which Python / venv is yours)
5. Never fails the workflow — offline, no remote, or package-manager install all degrade silently to `check_failed` / `not_a_git_repo` and research proceeds with the current version

When an update is applied you'll see a single line in the chat, e.g. `[Skill updated: abc123 → def456 (3 commits). Continuing with new version.]`. The success envelope also carries a `what_changed` field listing the top 5 `feat:` / `fix:` commit subjects from the new range, so the host LLM can summarize "what's new" without you having to run `git log` yourself.

**Pinning a version.** If you want to hold a specific commit — for a paper submission, a reproducibility run, or while a downstream script is being validated — set:

```bash
export SCHOLAR_SKIP_UPDATE_CHECK=1
```

With that set, the auto-update check short-circuits and the skill runs exactly the version on disk until you unset the variable. You can also combine with a `git checkout <sha>` to pin a specific historical version.

**Manual update** (also works as a last resort):

```bash
cd ~/.claude/skills/scholar-deep-research   # or your install path
git pull --ff-only
pip install -r requirements.txt              # only if you see the deps-changed hint
```

Users installed through a package manager (ClawHub, SkillsMP, Hermes registry) should use that manager's own update command instead; `check_update.py` will detect the non-git install and stay out of its way.

## Usage

Just describe what you want:

```
Run a deep research report on CRISPR base editing for Duchenne muscular dystrophy.
```

The agent will:
1. Restate the question and pick an archetype
2. Run multi-source searches with saturation tracking
3. Rank, dedupe, and select the top-N
4. Deep-read PDFs and extract evidence
5. Chase citations (forward + backward)
6. Cluster themes and map tensions
7. Run a self-critique pass
8. Render the chosen archetype with bibliography

The output lives at `reports/<slug>_<YYYYMMDD>.md` plus a `.bib` bibliography.

## Example phases

```
[Phase 0] Restating: "What is the current state of CRISPR base editing as a
          therapeutic for Duchenne muscular dystrophy?"
          Archetype: literature_review
          → research_state.json initialized

[Phase 1] OpenAlex + PubMed + arXiv + Crossref across 3 clusters...
          Round 1: 187 hits, 142 unique. Round 2: 94 hits, 31 new.
          Saturation: new=11%, max_new_citations=23 → SATURATED

[Phase 2] Ranking with literature-review weights...
          Top 20 selected. Score components written to state.
          Triage: 10 deep + 10 skim (--deep-ratio 0.5).
          Prefetch: 8/10 deep-tier PDFs cached, 2 paywalled (no OA).

[Phase 3] Deep tier: 8 parallel agents dispatched (1 wave) — each reads
          a local pdf_path, no per-agent download.
          8 returned full evidence; 2 paywalled papers carry
          evidence_unavailable from prefetch. Skim tier: 10
          abstract-derived evidence stubs auto-filled.

[Phase 4] Citation chasing on top 8 seeds, depth 1.
          Added 24 candidates, 6 re-scored into top 20.

[Phase 5] Themes: delivery, editing efficiency, off-target safety,
          pre-clinical, clinical translation.
          Tensions: AAV serotype optimality (3 papers disagree).

[Phase 6] Self-critique flagged 2 single-source claims and a recency gap.
          Ran focused search; added 4 papers.

[Phase 7] reports/crispr-base-editing-dmd_20260411.md (84 refs)

> **Note:** Only `SKILL.md` and `scripts/` are required for the skill to work. `references/` and `assets/` are progressive-disclosure resources the model loads on demand.

## Known Limitations

- **No Google Scholar / Web of Science / Scopus** — these have no public API or require institutional access. Mention in report appendix as "not consulted" if it matters.
- **Scanned PDFs** — `extract_pdf.py` detects them but doesn't OCR. Use a separate OCR step if needed.
- **DOI resolution requires open access** — `--doi` mode only finds legally open-access PDFs (via [paper-fetch](https://github.com/Agents365-ai/paper-fetch) or Unpaywall). Paywalled papers fall back to abstract-only.
- **arXiv has no citation counts** — arXiv-only papers get `citations=null` and a 0 contribution from the citation component of the rank score.
- **PubMed full abstracts** — fetched on demand only (`--with-abstracts`); the default round-trip uses esummary for speed.
- **English-language bias** — all four sources index non-English work but search quality varies. Note in the report's limitations if the topic has substantial non-English literature.
- **Ranking is bag-of-words for relevance** — for semantic re-ranking, plug an embedding model and write the result back into `state.papers[*].score_components.relevance`. The pipeline is designed for that override.
